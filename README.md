# Pomo-Extenstion
# The problem at hand
Everday students struggle to make commitments and stay discipliend to their studies and academic endeavours. Who can blame them when there are so many distractions on the World Wide Web. It has been reported that Adults spend up to 10.5 hours looking at a screen.
# The Proposed Solution
We wanted to mitigate the issue to keep students focused by incorporating a personalized pomodoro interface directly into the web browser via a built in extension. This extension will allow students to inout the links of websites they deem as distracting. While the extension is turned on, during the 25 min study period those sites that are deemed as distractions will be blocked. Thhose website will then be assecible again during the 5 minute break.

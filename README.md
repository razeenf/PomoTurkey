# Pomo-Extenstion
# The problem at hand
Everday students struggle to make commitments and stay disciplined to their studies and their academic endeavours. 

Who is to blame when there are so many distractions on the World Wide Web?

It has been reported that Adults spend up to 10.5 hours looking at a screen per day!
# The Proposed Solution
We wanted to mitigate the issue by keeping the users (students) focused by incorporating a personalized pomodoro interface directly into the web browser with a self built extension. This extension will allow students to inout the links of websites they deem as distracting. While the extension is turned on, during the 25 min study period those sites that are deemed as distractions will be blocked. Those website will then be a again accessible during the 5 minute break as per user conveninence.
